# wikidataviewer
this is a small project that uses wikidata's api and vis.js to visualize any item/entity from wikidata.
it only visualizes other items but it does show arrows indicating direction and also labels for the property they are connected by.

you can change the locale by modifying the `LANGUAGE` variable in `index.js`
